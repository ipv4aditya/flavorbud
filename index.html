        <h4>Pasta</h4>
        <p>
          Pasta is a staple of Italian cuisine, and the shapes and preparations
          vary across regions. From the iconic spaghetti Bolognese in the north
          to the orecchiette in the south, each region has its own pasta
          specialties. Popular pasta dishes include lasagna, fettuccine Alfredo,
          and ravioli.

        <h4>Pizza</h4>
        <p>
          Originating from Naples, pizza has become a global favorite.
          Traditional Neapolitan pizza has a thin, chewy crust and is topped
          with simple yet flavorful ingredients like fresh mozzarella, tomatoes,
          and basil. However, variations like Roman-style pizza and the diverse
          toppings found worldwide showcase the adaptability of this dish.

          abundance of fresh fish and shellfish used in Italian cooking. Wines
          Italian wines are celebrated globally, and each region is known for
          producing wines with unique characteristics. From the bold reds of
